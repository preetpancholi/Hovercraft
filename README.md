 # Remote Controlled Arduino Hovercraft [v2.0]
====================================
The point of making this repository is to explain how we made our hovercraft using arduino, which difficulties we faced and how we solved them. We made this hovercraft as our final project for CS 207.<br/>
Hovercraft is a vehicle which can hover over all the surfaces with the help of the air cushion below it. It can run on water, land, snow, etc. As I said it hovers on the surfaces, it has a light weight chasis which keeps it floating.<br/>
Our group had a common interest in making something remote-controlled. But as rc cars are too common so we all decided to pick up something different and came up with an idea of making an arduino remote controlled hovercraft. It seemed easy at first but later on we found it challenging and interesting.<br/>
The hovercraft looks like this when it was completed: <br/>
